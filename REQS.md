# In this challenge you’ll be writing a simple to-do list application with a twist.

Since you would be working with React and TypeScript as part of the Nigel team,
we ask that you do the same for your challenge.

Here’s the requirements:
Build a simple Trello board knockoff using React and TypeScript.  It doesn't have to look perfect, focus more on making it functional.
The board should have, at a minimum 3, hard coded columns for holding the to-do cards.
TODO
IN-PROGRESS
DONE

The cards can be very basic but should capture the text of what needs to be accomplished.
There needs to be a button someplace for adding new cards to the board.
The user should be able to transition the cards between the 3 columns.
How this is done is up to you.
How you handle the state of the application is completely up to you.  
Since this is a front-end only application, we don’t expect that that app state will survive a restart of the application.
We should be able to easily run the application locally on our laptop using a script in package.json.
Provide instructions on how the app works and how we can run it.
Feel free to add anything you think would make the application better.

## Other Requirements

Focus first on making the application functional and correct before making it fancy.  
If you have time and want to add features that's fine, but make sure it covers the basics first.  
Check your code into a Git repo and shoot us over a link. If you'd rather keep the repo private let me know and I'll give you my GitHub account so you can share directly. Use Git like you would with a team even though you're the only one working on this.  
We'll be looking over your commit history to get a feel for how you like to develop an application.
If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the requirements, please inform ICS and they will reach out to us directly.
